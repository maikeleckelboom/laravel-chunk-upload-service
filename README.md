# Laravel Chunk Upload Service

**Laravel Chunk Upload Service** is a powerful package designed to simplify the process of uploading large files in Laravel applications. By breaking down files into smaller, manageable chunks, this service ensures reliable and efficient file transfers, even over unstable network connections.

## Key Features

- **Chunked Uploads:** Splits large files into smaller chunks for improved reliability and easier error recovery.
- **Resumable Uploads:** Supports pausing and resuming of uploads, allowing users to recover from interruptions.
- **Parallel Uploads:** Supports uploading multiple chunks in parallel to speed up the process.
- **Automatic Assembly:** Once all chunks have been received, the service automatically assembles them into the final file.
- **Upload Management:** Provides endpoints to pause, delete, and monitor the status of uploads.
- **Cleanup Mechanism:** Ensures temporary data is removed after uploads are complete or cancelled, keeping the system clean.

## How It Works

1. **Uploading Chunks:**  
   Each file is divided into multiple chunks and sent to dedicated endpoints. The service stores each chunk temporarily on the server.
2. **Validation & Assembly:**  
   When all chunks have been uploaded, the system validates the complete file and merges the chunks into the final file.
3. **Management & Cleanup:**  
   Endpoints allow users to pause or cancel uploads, and the service cleans up any temporary data associated with incomplete uploads.

## Getting Started

- **Installation:**  
  Integrate the package into your Laravel project using Composer and configure it according to your application's needs.
- **Usage:**  
  Utilize the provided controllers (e.g., `UploadController`) and services (e.g., `UploadService`) to handle file uploads. These components manage chunk storage, assembly, and upload lifecycle operations.
- **Documentation:**  
  Detailed usage instructions and examples are available in the project documentation to help you get started quickly.

This service is ideal for applications requiring robust handling of large file uploadsâ€”ensuring a seamless and reliable user experience.
